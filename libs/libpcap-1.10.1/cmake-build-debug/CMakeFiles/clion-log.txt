CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:16 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0042 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PACKET)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Packet).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.

CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1836 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindAirPcap.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "AirPcap", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "AirPcap" with any
  of the following names:

    AirPcapConfig.cmake
    airpcap-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "AirPcap" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "AirPcap_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "AirPcap" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
